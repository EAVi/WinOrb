# WinOrb
A Spectrum Analyzer built for the chosen one's Orb of Pondering

This is very VERY rough code that I have no intention of polishing because I have cooler projects to work on

# Setup

1. You'll need Vulkan SDK
2. You'll need VS2019
3. Build the solution.
4. run shaders/CompileShaders.bat
5. run it
